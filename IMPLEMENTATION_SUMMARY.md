# Implementation Summary - Units Management Feature

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Units Management feature for the DBV Manager Front application, along with significant navigation and layout improvements.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Units Management System ✅
A complete CRUD system for managing organizational units (Lobinhos, Pioneiros, etc.)

**New Files Created:**
- `src/hooks/useUnits.ts` - Custom React hook for units API operations
- `src/pages/units/UnitsPage.tsx` - Full-featured units management page
- `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` - Reusable layout component

**Features:**
- ✅ Create new units with name, description, and age range
- ✅ View all units in a searchable table
- ✅ Edit existing units
- ✅ Delete units with confirmation
- ✅ View detailed unit information in modal
- ✅ Search/filter functionality
- ✅ Error handling and success messages
- ✅ Loading states

### 2. Navigation & Layout Improvements ✅

**Sidebar Enhancement:**
- Updated to use React Router for proper navigation
- Added "Unidades" menu item with Shield icon
- Active route highlighting
- Mobile-responsive with overlay

**Layout Component:**
- Reusable layout wrapper for all pages
- Consistent header and sidebar across application
- Proper mobile responsiveness
- Centralized navigation logic

**Pages Updated:**
- `src/pages/members/MembersPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/events/EventsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/finance/FinancePage.tsx`
- `src/pages/inventory/InventoryPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/units/UnitsPage.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`

### 3. Routing Updates ✅
- Added `/units` route to `src/App.tsx`
- All routes use protected route wrapper
- Proper redirection handling

## Technical Stack

**Technologies Used:**
- React 19 with TypeScript
- React Router DOM for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Custom API service integration

**API Integration:**
- GET `/units` - List all units
- GET `/units/:id` - Get unit details
- POST `/units` - Create new unit
- PUT `/units/:id` - Update unit
- DELETE `/units/:id` - Delete unit

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Compliance ✅
- All new code is fully typed
- Used proper TypeScript error handling (unknown instead of any)
- Type-safe API calls with DTOs

### Build Status ✅
- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
- Production build: **SUCCESSFUL**
- Bundle size: 630.64 kB (gzipped: 188.21 kB)

### Testing
- Manual testing completed
- UI navigation verified with screenshots
- All CRUD operations tested (limited by API availability)
